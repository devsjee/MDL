  alice s adventures in won#der#land by lewis carroll 1865 chap#ter i down the rab#bit hole alice was be#gin#ning to get ver#y tired of sit#ting by her sis#ter on the bank and of hav#ing noth#ing to do once or twice she had peep#e in#to the book her sis#ter was read#ing but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what i#s the use of a book thought alice with#out pictures or con#ver#sa#tion so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel ver#y sleep#y and stu#pid wheth#er the pleas#ure of mak#ing a dai#sy chain would be worth the trou#ble of get#ting up and pick#k the dai#sy#i when sud#den#ly a white rab#bit with pink eyes ran close by her there was noth#ing so ver#y re#mark#a#ble in that nor did alice think it so ver#y much out of the way to hear the rab#bit say to it#self oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it o#ver af#ter#ward#f it oc#curred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seem#e quite nat#u#ral but when the rab#bit ac#tu#al#ly took a watch out of its waist#coat pock#et and look#o at it and then hur#ried on alice start#a to her feet for it flash#a a#cross her mind that she had nev#er be#fore seen a rab#bit with ei#ther a waist#coat pock#et or a watch to take out of it and burn#ing with cu#ri#os#i#ty she ran a#cross the field af#ter it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rab#bit hole un#der the hedge in an#oth#er mo#ment down went alice af#ter it nev#er once considering how in the world she was to get out a#gain the rab#bit hole went straight on like a tun#nel for some way and then dip#p sud#den#ly down so sud#den#ly that alice had not a mo#ment to think a#bout stop#ping her#self be#fore she found her#self fall#ing down a ver#y deep well ei#ther the well was ver#y deep or she fell ver#y slow#ly for she had plen#ty of time as she went down to look a#bout her and to won#der what was go#ing to hap#pen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was com#ing to but it was too dark to see an#y#thing then she look#o at the sides of the well and no#ticed that they were filled with cup#board#u and book shelves he#re and there she saw map#a and pictures hung up#on peg#e she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was la#belled or#ange mar#ma#lade but to her great dis#ap#point#p it was emp#ty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of kill#ing some#bod#y so man#aged to put it in#to one of the cup#board#u as she fell past it well thought alice to her#self af#ter such a fall as this i shall think noth#ing of tum#bling down stairs how brave they ll all think me at home why i wouldn t say an#y#thing a#bout it e#ven if i fell off the top of the house which was ver#y like#ly true down down down would the fall nev#er come to an end i won#der how man#y miles i ve fall#en by this time she sa#id a#loud i must be get#ting some#where near the cent#n of the earth let me see that would be four thou#sand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt sev#er#al thing#h of this sort in her les#son#e in the school#room and though this was not a ver#y good opportunity for show#ing off her knowl#edge as there was no one to lis#ten to her still it was good prac#tice to say it o#ver yes that s a#bout the right dis#tance but then i won#der what lat#i#tude or lon#gi#tude i ve got to alice had no i#de#a what lat#i#tude was or lon#gi#tude ei#ther but thought they were nice grand words to say pres#ent#ly she be#gan a#gain i won#der if i shall fall right through the earth how fun#ny it ll seem to come out a#mong the peo#ple that walk with their heads down#ward the an#tip#a#thy#t i think she was ra#ther glad there was no one list#n this time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the coun#try i#s you know please ma a#m i#s this new zea#land or aus#tral#i#a and she tried to curt#sey as she spoke fan#cy curt#sey#t as you re fall#ing through the a#ir do you think you could man#age it and what an ig#no#rant lit#tle girl she ll think me for ask#i no it ll nev#er do to ask per#haps i shall see it writ#ten up some#where down down down there was noth#ing else to do so alice soon be#gan talk#k a#gain dinah ll miss me ver#y much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll re#mem#ber her sau#cer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down he#re with me there are no mice in the a#ir i m a#fraid but you might catch a bat and that s ver#y like a mouse you know but do cat#a eat bats i won#der and he#re alice be#gan to get ra#ther sleep#y and went on say#ing to her#self in a dream#y sort of way do cat#a eat bats do cat#a eat bats and some#times do bats eat cat#a for you see as she couldn t an#swer ei#ther ques#tion it didn t much mat#ter which way she put it she felt that she was doz#ing off and had just be#gun to dream that she was walk#ing hand in hand with dinah and say#ing to her ver#y ear#nest#ly now dinah tell me the truth did you ev#er eat a bat when sud#den#ly thump thump down she came up#on a heap of stick#t and dry leaves and the fall was o#ver alice was not a bit hurt and she jump#m up on to her feet in a mo#ment she look#o up but it was all dark o#ver#head be#fore her was an#oth#er long pas#sage and the white rab#bit was still in sight hur#ry#ing down it there was not a mo#ment to be lost a#way went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turn#r a cor#ner oh my ear#a and whisk#s how late it s get#ting she was close be#hind it when she turn#r the cor#ner but the rab#bit was no long#er to be seen she found her#self in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamp#a hang#ing from the roof there were door#o all round the hall but they were all lock#c and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the oth#er try#ing eve#ry door she walk#l sad#ly down the mid#dle won#der#ing how she was ev#er to get out a#gain sud#den#ly she came up#on a lit#tle three leg#ged ta#ble all made of sol#id glass there was noth#ing on it ex#cept a ti#ny gold#en key and alice s first thought was that it might be#long to one of the door#o of the hall but a#las ei#ther the lock#o were too large or the key was too small but at an#y rate it would not o#pen an#y of them how#ev#er on the se#cond time round she came up#on a low cur#tain she had not no#ticed be#fore and be#hind it was a lit#tle door a#bout fif#teen inch#c high she tried the lit#tle gold#en key in the lock and to her great de#light it fit#ted alice opened the door and found that it led in#to a small pas#sage not much larg#er than a rat hole she knelt down and look#o a#long the pas#sage in#to the love#li#est gar#den you ev#er saw how she long#n to get out of that dark hall and wan#der a#bout a#mong those beds of bright flow#w and those cool foun#tain#o but she could not e#ven get her head through the door#way and e#ven if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of ver#y lit#tle use with#out my should#u oh how i wish i could shut up like a tel#e#scope i think i could if i on#ly know how to be#gin for you see so man#y out of the way thing#h had hap#n late#ly that alice had be#gun to think that ver#y few thing#h in#deed were re#al#ly im#pos#si#ble there seem#e to be no use in wait#t by the lit#tle door so she went back to the ta#ble half hop#ing she might find an#oth#er key on it or at an#y rate a book of rules for shut#ting peo#ple up like telescopes this time she found a lit#tle bot#tle on it which cer#tain#ly was not he#re be#fore sa#id alice and round the neck of the bot#tle was a pa#per la#bel with the words drink me beau#ty#i print#i on it in large let#ters it was all ver#y well to say drink me but the wise lit#tle alice was not go#ing to do that in a hur#ry no i ll look first she sa#id and see wheth#er it s marked poi#son or not for she had read sev#er#al nice lit#tle histories a#bout chil#dren who had got burnt and eat#en up by wild beast#e and oth#er un#pleas#ant thing#h all be#cause they would not re#mem#ber the sim#ple rules their friend#r had taught them such as that a red hot pok#er will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your fin#ger ver#y deep#ly with a knife it u#su#al#ly bleeds and she had nev#er for#got#ten that if you drink much from a bot#tle marked poi#son it i#s al#most cer#tain to dis#a#gree with you soon#er or lat#er how#ev#er this bot#tle was not marked poi#son so alice ven#tured to taste it and find#ing it ver#y nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cher#ry tart cus#tard pine ap#ple roast tur#key tof#fee and hot but#r toast she ver#y soon fin#ished it off what a cu#ri#ous feel#ing sa#id alice i must be shut#ting up like a tel#e#scope and so it was in#deed she was now on#ly ten inch#c high and her face bright#h up at the thought that she was now the right size for go#ing through the lit#tle door in#to that love#ly gar#den first how#ev#er she wait#i for a few min#utes to see if she was go#ing to shrink an#y fur#ther she felt a lit#tle nerv#ous a#bout this for it might end you know sa#id alice to her#self in my go#ing out al#to#geth#er like a can#dle i won#der what i should be like then and she tried to fan#cy what the flame of a can#dle i#s like af#ter the can#dle i#s blown out for she could not re#mem#ber ev#er hav#ing seen such a thing af#ter a while find#ing that noth#ing more hap#n she de#cid#ed on go#ing in#to the gar#den at once but a#las for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had for#got#ten the lit#tle gold#en key and when she went back to the ta#ble for it she found she could not pos#si#bly reach it she could see it quite plain#ly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the leg#e of the ta#ble but it was too slip#per#y and when she had tired her#self out with try#ing the poor lit#tle thing sat down and cried come there s no use in cry#ing like that sa#id alice to her#self ra#ther sharp#ly i ad#vise you to leave off this mi#nute she gen#er#al#ly gave her#self ver#y good ad#vice though she ver#y sel#dom fol#low#l it and some#times she scold#o her#self so se#vere#ly as to br#ing tears in#to her eyes and once she remembered try#ing to box her own ear#a for hav#ing cheated her#self in a game of cro#quet she was play#y a#gainst her#self for this cu#ri#ous child was ver#y fond of pre#tend#t to be two peo#ple but it s no use now thought poor alice to pre#tend to be two peo#ple why there s hard#ly e#nough of me left to make one re#spect#e per#son soon her eye fell on a lit#tle glass box that was ly#ing un#der the ta#ble she opened it and found in it a ver#y small cake on which the words eat me were beau#ty#i marked in cur#n well i ll eat it sa#id alice and if it makes me grow larg#er i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep un#der the door so ei#ther way i ll get in#to the gar#den and i don t care which hap#e she a#te a lit#tle bit and sa#id anx#ious#ly to her#self which way which way hold#ing her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was grow#ing and she was quite sur#prised to find that she re#main#m the same size to be sure this gen#er#al#ly hap#e when one eats cake but alice had got so much in#to the way of ex#pect#ing noth#ing but out of the way thing#h to hap#pen that it seem#e quite dull and stu#pid for life to go on in the com#mon way so she set to work and ver#y soon fin#ished off the cake chap#ter ii the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much sur#prised that for the mo#ment she quite for#got how to speak good eng#lish now i m o#pen#ing out like the larg#est tel#e#scope that ev#er was good bye feet for when she look#o down at her feet they seem#e to be al#most out of sight they were get#ting so far off oh my poor lit#tle feet i won#der who will put on your shoes and stock#k for you now dear#e i m sure i shan t be a#ble i shall be a great deal too far off to trou#ble my#self a#bout you you must man#age the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or per#haps they won t walk the way i want to go let me see i ll give them a new pair of boots eve#ry christ#mas and she went on plan#ning to her#self how she would man#age it they must go by the car#ri#er she thought and how fun#ny it ll seem send#ing pres#ents to one s own feet and how odd the di#rec#tions will look alice s right foot esq hearthrug near the fend#er with alice s love oh dear what non#sense i m talk#k just then her head struck a#gainst the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the lit#tle gold#en key and hur#ried off to the gar#den door poor alice it was as much as she could do ly#ing down on one side to look through in#to the gar#den with one eye but to get through was more hope#less than ev#er she sat down and be#gan to cry a#gain you ought to be a#shamed of your#self sa#id alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on cry#ing in this way stop this mo#ment i tell you but she went on all the same shed#ding gal#lon#a of tears un#til there was a large pool all round her a#bout four inch#c deep and reach#c half down the hall af#ter a time she heard a lit#tle pat#i of feet in the dis#tance and she hast#i#ly dried her eyes to see what was com#ing it was the white rab#bit re#turn#u splen#did#ly dress#e with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the oth#er he came trot#ting a#long in a great hur#ry muttering to him#self as he came oh the duch#ess the duch#ess oh won t she be sav#age if i ve kept her wait#t alice felt so des#per#ate that she was read#y to ask help of an#y one so when the rab#bit came near her she be#gan in a low tim#id voice if you please sir the rab#bit start#a vi#ol#n drop#p the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried a#way in#to the dark#ness as hard as he could go alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was ver#y hot she kept fan#ning her#self all the time she went on talk#k dear dear how queer eve#ry#thing i#s to day and yes#ter#day thing#h went on just as u#su#al i won#der if i ve been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morn#ing i al#most think i can re#mem#ber feel#ing a lit#tle dif#fer#ent but if i m not the same the next ques#tion i#s who in the world a#m i ah that s the great puz#zle and she be#gan think#ing o#ver all the chil#dren she knew that were of the same age as her#self to see if she could have been changed for an#y of them i m sure i m not ada she sa#id for her hair goes in such long ring#let#i and mine doesn t go in ring#let#i at all and i m sure i can t be mabel for i know all sort#o of thing#h and she oh she know#n such a ver#y lit#tle be#sides she s she and i m i and oh dear how puzzling it all i#s i ll try if i know all the thing#h i used to know let me see four times five i#s twelve and four times six i#s thir#teen and four times sev#en i#s oh dear i shall nev#er get to twen#ty at that rate how#ev#er the mul#ti#pli#ca#tion ta#ble doesn t sig#ni#fy let s try ge#og#ra#phy lon#don i#s the cap#i#tal of pa#r#r and pa#r#r i#s the cap#i#tal of rome and rome no that s all wrong i m cer#tain i must have been changed for mabel i ll try and say how doth the lit#tle and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were say#ing les#son#e and be#gan to re#peat it but her voice sound#u hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do how doth the lit#tle croc#o#dile im#prove his shin#ing tail and pour the waters of the nil#i on eve#ry gold#en scale how cheer#ful#ly he seem#e to grin how neat#ly spread his claw#l and wel#come lit#tle fish#es in with gen#tly smil#ing jaws i m sure those are not the right words sa#id poor alice and her eyes filled with tears a#gain as she went on i must be mabel af#ter all and i shall have to go and live in that pok#y lit#tle house and have next to no toy#o to play with and oh ev#er so man#y les#son#e to learn no i ve made up my mind a#bout it if i m mabel i ll stay down he#re it ll be no use their put#ting their heads down and say#ing come up a#gain dear i shall on#ly look up and say who a#m i then tell me that first and then if i like be#ing that per#son i ll come up if not i ll stay down he#re till i m some#bod#y else but oh dear cried alice with a sud#den burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i a#m so ver#y tired of be#ing all a#lone he#re as she sa#id this she look#o down at her hands and was sur#prised to see that she had put on one of the rab#bit s lit#tle white kid gloves while she was talk#k how can i have done that she thought i must be grow#ing small a#gain she got up and went to the ta#ble to meas#ure her#self by it and found that as near#ly as she could guess she was now a#bout two feet high and was go#ing on shrink#ing rap#id#ly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was hold#ing and she drop#p it hast#i#ly just in time to a#void shrink#ing a#way al#to#geth#er that was a nar#row es#cape sa#id alice a good deal fright#ened at the sud#den change but ver#y glad to find her#self still in ex#ist#ence and now for the gar#den and she ran with all speed back to the lit#tle door but a#las the lit#tle door was shut a#gain and the lit#tle gold#en key was ly#ing on the glass ta#ble as be#fore and thing#h are worse than ev#er thought the poor child for i nev#er was so small as this be#fore nev#er and i de#clare it s too bad that it i#s as she sa#id these words her foot slip#p and in an#oth#er mo#ment splash she was up to her chin in salt wa#ter her first i#de#a was that she had some#how fall#en in#to the sea and in that case i can go back by rail#way she sa#id to her#self alice had been to the sea#side once in her life and had come to the gen#er#al con#clu#sion that wher#ev#er you go to on the eng#lish coast you find a num#ber of bath#ing machines in the sea some chil#dren dig#ging in the sand with wood#en spades then a row of lodg#ing hous#es and be#hind them a rail#way sta#tion how#ev#er she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high i wish i hadn t cried so much sa#id alice as she swam a#bout try#ing to find her way out i shall be pun#h for it now i sup#pose by be#ing drown#o in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure how#ev#er eve#ry#thing i#s queer to day just then she heard some#thing splashing a#bout in the pool a lit#tle way off and she swam near#a to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a wal#rus or hip#po#pot#a#mus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was on#ly a mouse that had slip#p in like her#self would it be of an#y use now thought alice to speak to this mouse eve#ry#thing i#s so out of the way down he#re that i should think ver#y like#ly it can talk at an#y rate there s no harm in try#ing so she be#gan o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i a#m ver#y tired of swim#ming a#bout he#re o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speak#ing to a mouse she had nev#er done such a thing be#fore but she remembered hav#ing seen in her broth#er s lat#in gram#mar a mouse of a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse the mouse look#o at her ra#ther inquisitively and seem#e to her to wink with one of its lit#tle eyes but it sa#id noth#ing per#haps it doesn t un#der#stand eng#lish thought alice i daresay it s a french mouse come o#ver with wil#liam the con#quer#or for with all her knowl#edge of his#to#ry alice had no ver#y clear no#tion how long a#go an#y#thing had hap#n so she be#gan a#gain ou est ma chat#a which was the first sen#tence in her french les#son book the mouse gave a sud#den leap out of the wa#ter and seem#e to quiv#er all o#ver with fright oh i beg your par#don cried alice hast#i#ly a#fraid that she had hurt the poor an#i#mal s feel#i i quite for#got you didn t like cat#a not like cat#a cried the mouse in a shrill pas#sion#ate voice would you like cat#a if you were me well per#haps not sa#id alice in a sooth#ing tone don t be an#gry a#bout it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a fan#cy to cat#a if you could on#ly see her she i#s such a dear qui#et thing alice went on half to her#self as she swam la#zi#ly a#bout in the pool and she sit#i purring so nice#ly by the fire lick#ing her paw#a and wash#ing her face and she i#s such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a cap#i#tal one for catch#ing mice oh i beg your par#don cried alice a#gain for this time the mouse was bristling all o#ver and she felt cer#tain it must be re#al#ly of#fend#f we won t talk a#bout her an#y more if you d ra#ther not we in#deed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a sub#ject our fam#i#ly al#ways hat#ed cat#a nas#ty low vul#gar thing#h don t let me hear the name a#gain i won t in#deed sa#id alice in a great hur#ry to change the sub#ject of con#ver#sa#tion are you are you fond of of dogs the mouse did not an#swer so alice went on ea#ger#ly there i#s such a nice lit#tle dog near our house i should like to show you a lit#tle bright eyed ter#ri#er you know with oh such long curl#y brown hair and it ll fetch thing#h when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its din#ner and all sort#o of thing#h i can t re#mem#ber half of them and it be#long#e to a far#mer you know and he say#a it s so use#ful it s worth a hun#dred pound#o he say#a it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a sor#row#ful tone i m a#fraid i ve of#fend#f it a#gain for the mouse was swim#ming a#way from her as hard as it could go and mak#ing quite a com#mo#tion in the pool as it went so she called soft#ly af#ter it mouse dear do come back a#gain and we won t talk a#bout cat#a or dogs ei#ther if you don t like them when the mouse heard this it turn#r round and swam slow#ly back to her its face was quite pale with pas#sion alice thought and it sa#id in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i ll tell you my his#to#ry and you ll un#der#stand why it i#s i hate cat#a and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was get#ting quite crowd#ed with the bird#i and animals that had fall#en in#to it there were a duck and a do#do a lory and an ea#glet and sev#er#al oth#er cu#ri#ous creatures alice led the way and the whole par#ty swam to the shore chap#ter iii a cau#cus race and a long tale they were in#deed a queer look#k par#ty that as#sem#bled on the bank the bird#i with draggled feath#ers the animals with their fur cling#ing close to them and all drip#ping wet cross and uncomfortable the first ques#tion of course was how to get dry a#gain they had a con#sul#ta#tion a#bout this and af#ter a few min#utes it seem#e quite nat#u#ral to alice to find her#self talk#k fa#mil#iar#ly with them as if she had known them all her life in#deed she had quite a long ar#gu#ment with the lory who at last turn#r sulk#y and would on#ly say i a#m old#er than you and must know bet#ter and this alice would not al#low with#out know#ing how old it was and as the lory pos#i#tive#ly re#fused to tell its age there was no more to be sa#id at last the mouse who seem#e to be a per#son of au#thor#i#ty a#mong them called out sit down all of you and lis#ten to me i ll soon make you dry e#nough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the mid#dle alice kept her eyes anx#ious#ly fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry ver#y soon a#hem sa#id the mouse with an im#por#tant a#ir are you all read#y this i#s the dri#est thing i know si#lence all round if you please wil#liam the con#quer#or whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon sub#mit#ted to by the eng#lish who want#n lead#d and had been of late much ac#cus#tomed to u#sur#pa#tion and con#quest edwin and morcar the earl#a of mercia and northumbria ugh sa#id the lory with a shiv#er i beg your par#don sa#id the mouse frown#w but ver#y po#lite#ly did you speak not i sa#id the lory hast#i#ly i thought you did sa#id the mouse i pro#ceed edwin and morcar the earl#a of mercia and northumbria de#clared for him and e#ven stigand the pa#tri#ot#ic arch#bish#op of can#ter#bur#y found it ad#vis#a#ble found what sa#id the duck found it the mouse re#ply#p ra#ther cross#ly of course you know what it means i know what it means well e#nough when i find a thing sa#id the duck it s gen#er#al#ly a frog or a worm the ques#tion i#s what did the arch#bish#op find the mouse did not no#tice this ques#tion but hur#ried#ly went on found it ad#vis#a#ble to go with edgar atheling to meet wil#liam and of#fer him the crown wil#liam s con#duct at first was mod#er#ate but the in#so#lence of his norm#m how are you get#ting on now my dear it con#tin#ued turn#ing to alice as it spoke as wet as ev#er sa#id alice in a mel#an#chol#y tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that case sa#id the do#do sol#emn#ly ris#ing to its feet i move that the meet#ing ad#journ for the im#me#di#ate a#dop#tion of more en#er#get#ic rem#e#dy#m speak eng#lish sa#id the ea#glet i don t know the mean#ing of half those long words and what s more i don t be#lieve you do ei#ther and the ea#glet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the oth#er bird#i tit#r au#di#bly what i was go#ing to say sa#id the do#do in an of#fend#f tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a cau#cus race what i#s a cau#cus race sa#id alice not that she want#n much to know but the do#do had paused as if it thought that some#bod#y ought to speak and no one else seem#e in#clined to say an#y#thing why sa#id the do#do the best way to ex#plain it i#s to do it and as you might like to try the thing your#self some

while how#ev#er she a#gain heard a lit#tle pat#i of foot#step#o in the dis#tance and she look#o up ea#ger#ly half hop#ing that the mouse had changed his mind and was com#ing back to fin#ish his sto#ry chap#ter iv the rab#bit send#e in a lit#tle bill it was the white rab#bit trot#ting slow#ly back a#gain and look#k anx#ious#ly a#bout as it went as if it had lost some#thing and she heard it muttering to it#self the duch#ess the duch#ess oh my dear paw#a oh my fur and whisk#s she ll get me ex#e#cut#ed as sure as fer#ret#e are fer#ret#e where can i have drop#p them i won#der alice guess#e in a mo#ment that it was look#k for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she ver#y good naturedly be#gan hunt#ing a#bout for them but they were no#where to be seen eve#ry#thing seem#e to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass ta#ble and the lit#tle door had van#h com#plete#ly ver#y soon the rab#bit no#ticed alice as she went hunt#ing a#bout and called out to her in an an#gry tone why mar#y ann what are you do#ing out he#re run home this mo#ment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much fright#ened that she ran off at once in the di#rec#tion it point#ed to with#out try#ing to ex#plain the mis#take it had made he took me for his house#maid she sa#id to her#self as she ran how sur#prised he ll be when he find#i out who i a#m but i d bet#ter take him his fan and gloves that i#s if i can find them as she sa#id this she came up#on a neat lit#tle house on the door of which was a bright bras#s plate with the name w rab#bit en#graved up#on it she went in with#out knock#c and hur#ried up#stairs in great fear lest she should meet the re#al mar#y ann and be turn#r out of the house be#fore she had found the fan and gloves how queer it seem#e alice sa#id to her#self to be go#ing mess#a for a rab#bit i sup#pose dinah ll be send#ing me on mess#a next and she be#gan fan#cy#ing the sort of thing that would hap#pen miss alice come he#re di#rect#ly and get read#y for your walk com#ing in a mi#nute nurse but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out on#ly i don t think alice went on that they d let dinah stop in the house if it be#gan ordering peo#ple a#bout like that by this time she had found her way in#to a tid#y lit#tle room with a ta#ble in the win#dow and on it as she had hop#p a fan and two or three pairs of ti#ny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just go#ing to leave the room when her eye fell up#on a lit#tle bot#tle that stood near the look#k glass there was no la#bel this time with the words drink me but nev#er#the#less she un#cork#c it and put it to her lip#i i know some#thing in#ter#est#ing i#s sure to hap#pen she sa#id to her#self when#ev#er i eat or drink an#y#thing so i ll just see what this bot#tle does i do hope it ll make me grow large a#gain for re#al#ly i m quite tired of be#ing such a ti#ny lit#tle thing it did so in#deed and much soon#er than she had ex#pect#p be#fore she had drunk half the bot#tle she found her head press#ing a#gainst the ceil#ing and had to stoop to save her neck from be#ing bro#ken she hast#i#ly put down the bot#tle say#ing to her#self that s quite e#nough i hope i shan t grow an#y more as it i#s i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so much a#las it was too late to wish that she went on grow#ing and grow#ing and ver#y soon had to kneel down on the floor in an#oth#er mi#nute there was not e#ven room for this and she tried the ef#fect of ly#ing down with one el#bow a#gainst the door and the oth#er arm curl#r round her head still she went on grow#ing and as a last re#source she put one arm out of the win#dow and one foot up the chim#ney and sa#id to her#self now i can do no more what#ev#er hap#e what will be#come of me luck#i#ly for alice the lit#tle mag#ic bot#tle had now had its full ef#fect and she grew no larg#er still it was ver#y uncomfortable and as there seem#e to be no sort of chance of her ev#er get#ting out of the room a#gain no won#der she felt un#hap#py it was much pleas#a at home thought poor alice when one wasn t al#ways grow#ing larg#er and smaller and be#ing ordered a#bout by mice and rab#bit#a i al#most wish i hadn t gone down that rab#bit hole and yet and yet it s ra#ther cu#ri#ous you know this sort of life i do won#der what can have hap#n to me when i used to read fair#y ta#les i fan#cied that kind of thing nev#er hap#n and now he#re i a#m in the mid#dle of one there ought to be a book writ#ten a#bout me that there ought and when i grow up i ll write one but i m grown up now she added in a sor#row#ful tone at least there s no room to grow up an#y more he#re but then thought alice shall i nev#er get an#y old#er than i a#m now that ll be a com#fort one way nev#er to be an old wom#an but then al#ways to have les#son#e to learn oh i shouldn t like that oh you fool#ish alice she answered her#self how can you learn les#son#e in he#re why there s hard#ly room for you and no room at all for an#y les#son book#o and so she went on tak#ing first one side and then the oth#er and mak#ing quite a con#ver#sa#tion of it al#to#geth#er but af#ter a few min#utes she heard a voice out#side and stopped to lis#ten mar#y ann mar#y ann sa#id the voice fetch me my gloves this mo#ment then came a lit#tle pat#i of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rab#bit com#ing to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite for#get#ting that she was now a#bout a thou#sand times as large as the rab#bit and had no rea#son to be a#fraid of it pres#ent#ly the rab#bit came up to the door and tried to o#pen it but as the door opened in#wards and alice s el#bow was press#e hard a#gainst it that at#tempt proved a fail#ure alice heard it say to it#self then i ll go round and get in at the win#dow that you won t thought alice and af#ter wait#t till she fan#cied she heard the rab#bit just un#der the win#dow she sud#den#ly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the a#ir she did not get hold of an#y#thing but she heard a lit#tle shriek and a fall and a crash of bro#ken glass from which she con#clud#ed that it was just pos#si#ble it had fall#en in#to a cu#cum#ber frame or some#thing of the sort next came an an#gry voice the rab#bit s pat pat where are you and then a voice she had nev#er heard be#fore sure then i m he#re dig#ging for ap#ples yer hon#our dig#ging for ap#ples in#deed sa#id the rab#bit an#gri#ly he#re come and help me out of this sound#o of more bro#ken glass now tell me pat what s that in the win#dow sure it s an arm yer hon#our he pro#nounced it arrum an arm you goose who ev#er saw one that size why it fills the whole win#dow sure it does yer hon#our but it s an arm for all that well it s got no busi#ness there at an#y rate go and take it a#way there was a long si#lence af#ter this and alice could on#ly hear whispers now and then such as sure i don t like it yer hon#our at all at all do as i tell you you cow#ard and at last she spread out her hand a#gain and made an#oth#er snatch in the a#ir this time there were two lit#tle shrieks and more sound#o of bro#ken glass what a num#ber of cu#cum#ber frames there must be thought alice i won#der what they ll do next as for pulling me out of the win#dow i on#ly wish they could i m sure i don t want to stay in he#re an#y long#er she wait#i for some time with#out hear#ing an#y#thing more at last came a rumbling of lit#tle cart#wheel#a and the sound of a good man#y voices all talk#k to#geth#er she made out the words where s the oth#er lad#der why i hadn t to br#ing but one bill s got the oth#er bill fetch it he#re lad he#re put em up at this cor#ner no tie em to#geth#er first they don t reach half high e#nough yet oh they ll do well e#nough don t be par#tic#u#lar he#re bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it s com#ing down heads be#low a loud crash now who did that it was bill i fan#cy who s to go down the chim#ney nay i shan t you do it that i won t then bill s to go down he#re bill the mas#ter say#a you re to go down the chim#ney oh so bill s got to come down the chim#ney has he sa#id alice to her#self shy they seem to put eve#ry#thing up#on bill i wouldn t be in bill s place for a good deal this fire#place i#s nar#row to be sure but i think i can kick a lit#tle she drew her foot as far down the chim#ney as she could and wait#i till she heard a lit#tle an#i#mal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling a#bout in the chim#ney close a#bove her then say#ing to her#self this i#s bill she gave one sharp kick and wait#i to see what would hap#pen next the first thing she heard was a gen#er#al cho#rus of there goes bill then the rab#bit s voice a#long catch him you by the hedge then si#lence and then an#oth#er con#fu#sion of voices hold up his head bran#dy now don t choke him how was it old fel#low what hap#n to you tell us all a#bout it last came a lit#tle fee#ble squeak#e voice that s bill thought alice well i hard#ly know no more thank ye i m bet#ter now but i m a deal too flustered to tell you all i know i#s some#thing co#mes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes like a sky rock#et so you did old fel#low sa#id the others we must burn the house down sa#id the rab#bit s voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do i ll set dinah at you there was a dead si#lence in#stant#ly and alice thought to her#self i won#der what they will do next if they had an#y sense they d take the roof off af#ter a mi#nute or two they be#gan mov#ing a#bout a#gain and alice heard the rab#bit say a bar#row#r will do to be#gin with a bar#row#r of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next mo#ment a show#er of lit#tle pebbles came rat#tling in at the win#dow and some of them hit her in the face i ll put a stop to this she sa#id to her#self and shout#o out you d bet#ter not do that a#gain which pro#duced an#oth#er dead si#lence alice no#ticed with some sur#prise that the pebbles were all turn#ing in#to lit#tle cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright i#de#a came in#to her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t pos#si#bly make me larg#er it must make me smaller i sup#pose so she swal#low#a one of the cakes and was de#light#ed to find that she be#gan shrink#ing di#rect#ly as soon as she was small e#nough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of lit#tle animals and bird#i wait#t out#side the poor lit#tle liz#ard bill was in the mid#dle be#ing held up by two guin#ea pigs who were giv#ing it some#thing out of a bot#tle they all made a rush at alice the mo#ment she ap#pear#p but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found her#self safe in a thick wood the first thing i ve got to do sa#id alice to her#self as she wand#e a#bout in the wood i#s to grow to my right size a#gain and the se#cond thing i#s to find my way in#to that love#ly gar#den i think that will be the best plan it sound#u an ex#cel#lent plan no doubt and ver#y neat#ly and sim#ply ar#ranged the on#ly dif#fi#cul#ty was that she had not the smallest i#de#a how to set a#bout it and while she was peer#r a#bout anx#ious#ly a#mong the trees a lit#tle sharp bark just o#ver her head made her look up in a great hur#ry an e#nor#mous pup#py was look#k down at her with large round eyes and fee#bly stretching out one paw try#ing to tou#ch her poor lit#tle thing sa#id alice in a co#ax#x tone and she tried hard to whis#tle to it but she was ter#ri#bly fright#ened all the time at the thought that it might be hun#gry in which case it would be ver#y like#ly to eat her up in spite of all her co#ax#x hard#ly know#ing what she did she pick#ed up a lit#tle bit of stick and held it out to the pup#py where#u#pon the pup#py jump#m in#to the a#ir off all its feet at once with a yelp of de#light and rush#s at the stick and made be#lieve to wor#ry it then alice dodged be#hind a great this#tle to keep her#self from be#ing run o#ver and the mo#ment she ap#pear#p on the oth#er side the pup#py made an#oth#er rush at the stick and tumbled head o#ver heel#e in its hur#ry to get hold of it then alice think#ing it was ver#y like hav#ing a game of play with a cart horse and ex#pect#ing eve#ry mo#ment to be trampled un#der its feet ran round the this#tle a#gain then the pup#py be#gan a se#ries of short charges at the stick run#ning a ver#y lit#tle way for#wards each time and a long way back and bark#ing hoarse#ly all the while till at last it sat down a good way off pant#t with its tongue hang#ing out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut this seem#e to alice a good opportunity for mak#ing her es#cape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the pup#py s bark sound#u quite faint in the dis#tance and yet what a dear lit#tle pup#py it was sa#id alice as she leant a#gainst a but#ter#cup to rest her#self and fan#n her#self with one of the leaves i should have liked teach#ing it trick#r ver#y much if if i d on#ly been the right size to do it oh dear i d near#ly for#got#ten that i ve got to grow up a#gain let me see how i#s it to be man#aged i sup#pose i ought to eat or drink some#thing or oth#er but the great ques#tion i#s what the great ques#tion cer#tain#ly was what alice look#o all round her at the flow#w and the blades of grass but she did not see an#y#thing that look#o like the right thing to eat or drink un#der the circumstances there was a large mush#room grow#ing near her a#bout the same height as her#self and when she had look#o un#der it and on both sides of it and be#hind it it oc#curred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it she stretched her#self up on tip#toe and peep#e o#ver the edge of the mush#room and her eyes im#me#di#ate#ly met those of a large cat#er#pil#lar that was sit#ting on the top with its arms fold#l qui#et#ly smo#king a long hook#ah and tak#ing not the smallest no#tice of her or of an#y#thing else chap#ter v ad#vice from a cat#er#pil#lar the cat#er#pil#lar and alice look#o at each oth#er for some time in si#lence at last the cat#er#pil#lar took the hook#ah out of its mouth and ad#dress#d her in a lan#guid sleep#y voice who are you sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar this was not an encouraging o#pen#ing for a con#ver#sa#tion alice re#ply#p ra#ther shy#ly i i hard#ly know sir just at pre#sent at least i know who i was when i got up this morn#ing but i think i must have been changed sev#er#al times since then what do you mean by that sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar stern#e ex#plain your#self i can t ex#plain my#self i m a#fraid sir sa#id alice be#cause i m not my#self you see i don t see sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar i m a#fraid i can t put it more clear#ly alice re#ply#p ver#y po#lite#ly for i can t un#der#stand it my#self to be#gin with and be#ing so man#y dif#fer#ent sizes in a day i#s ver#y con#fus#ing it isn t sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar well per#haps you ha#ven t found it so yet sa#id alice but when you have to turn in#to a chrys#a#lis you will some day you know and then af#ter that in#to a but#ter#fly i should think you ll feel it a lit#tle queer won t you not a bit sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar well per#haps your feel#i may be dif#fer#ent sa#id alice all i know i#s it would feel ver#y queer to me you sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar contemptuously who are you which brought them back a#gain to the be#gin#ning of the con#ver#sa#tion alice felt a lit#tle ir#ri#tat#ed at the cat#er#pil#lar s mak#ing such ver#y short re#mark#e and she drew her#self up and sa#id ver#y grave#ly i think you ought to tell me who you are first why sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar he#re was an#oth#er puzzling ques#tion and as alice could not think of an#y good rea#son and as the cat#er#pil#lar seem#e to be in a ver#y un#pleas#ant state of mind she turn#r a#way come back the cat#er#pil#lar called af#ter her i ve some#thing im#por#tant to say this sound#u prom#is#ing cer#tain#ly alice turn#r and came back a#gain keep your tem#per sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar i#s that all sa#id alice swal#low#l down her an#ger as well as she could no sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar alice thought she might as well wait as she had noth#ing else to do and per#haps af#ter all it might tell her some#thing worth hear#ing for some min#utes it puff#f a#way with#out speak#ing but at last it un#fold#f its arms took the hook#ah out of its mouth a#gain and sa#id so you think you re changed do you i m a#fraid i a#m sir sa#id alice i can t re#mem#ber thing#h as i used and i don t keep the same size for ten min#utes to#geth#er can t re#mem#ber what thing#h sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar well i ve tried to say how doth the lit#tle bus#y bee but it all came dif#fer#ent alice re#ply#p in a ver#y mel#an#chol#y voice re#peat you are old fa#ther wil#liam sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar alice fold#l her hands and be#gan you are old fa#ther wil#liam the young man sa#id and your hair has be#come ver#y white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it i#s right in my youth fa#ther wil#liam re#ply#p to his son i fear#a it

cat#er#pil#lar not quite right i m a#fraid sa#id alice tim#id#ly some of the words have got altered it i#s wrong from be#gin#ning to end sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar de#cid#ed#ly and there was si#lence for some min#utes the cat#er#pil#lar was the first to speak what size do you want to be it ask#k oh i m not par#tic#u#lar as to size alice hast#i#ly re#ply#p on#ly one doesn t like chang#ing so of#ten you know i don t know sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar alice sa#id noth#ing she had nev#er been so much con#tra#dict#n in her life be#fore and she felt that she was los#ing her tem#per are you con#tent now

creatures wouldn t be so eas#i#ly of#fend#f you ll get used to it in time sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar and it put the hook#ah in#to its mouth and be#gan smo#king a#gain this time alice wait#i pa#tient#ly un#til it chose to speak a#gain in a mi#nute or two the cat#er#pil#lar took the hook#ah out of its mouth and yawn#w once or twice and shook it#self then it got down off the mush#room and crawl#a a#way in the grass mere#ly re#mark#a as it went one side will make you grow taller and the oth#er side will make you grow short#o one side of what the oth#er side of what thought alice to her#self of the mush#room sa#id the cat#er#pil#lar just as if she had ask#k it a#loud and in an#oth#er mo#ment it was out of sight alice re#main#m look#k thought#h at the mush#room for a mi#nute try#ing to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was per#fect#ly round she found this a ver#y dif#fi#cult ques#tion how#ev#er at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which i#s which she sa#id to her#self and nibbled a lit#tle of the right hand bit to try the ef#fect the next mo#ment she felt a vi#o#lent b#low un#der#neath her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal fright#ened by this ver#y sud#den change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrink#ing rap#id#ly so she set to work at once to eat some of the oth#er bit her chin was press#e so close#ly a#gainst her foot that there was hard#ly room to o#pen her mouth but she did it at last and man#aged to swal#low a mor#sel of the lefthand bit come my head s free at last sa#id alice in a tone of de#light which changed in#to a#larm in an#oth#er mo#ment when she found that her should#u were no#where to be found all she could see when she look#o down was an im#mense length of neck which seem#e to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far be#low her what can all that green stuff be sa#id alice and where have my should#u got to and oh my poor hands how i#s it i can t see you she was mov#ing them a#bout as she spoke but no re#sult seem#e to fol#low ex#cept a lit#tle shak#ing a#mong the dis#tant green leaves as there seem#e to be no chance of get#ting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was de#light#ed to find that her neck would bend a#bout eas#i#ly in an#y di#rec#tion like a ser#pent she had just suc#cess#c in curv#ing it down in#to a grace#ful zig#zag and was go#ing to dive in a#mong the leaves which she found to be noth#ing but the tops of the trees un#der which she had been wan#der#ing when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hur#ry a large pi#geon had flown in#to her face and was beat#ing her vi#ol#n with its wing#i ser#pent screamed the pi#geon i m not a ser#pent sa#id alice indignantly let me a#lone ser#pent i say a#gain re#peat#ed the pi#geon but in a more sub#dued tone and added with a kind of sob i ve tried eve#ry way and noth#ing seem#e to suit them i ha#ven t the least i#de#a what you re talk#k a#bout sa#id alice i ve tried the root#o of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve tried hedges the pi#geon went on with#out at#tend#ing to her but those serpents there s no pleas#ing them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in say#ing an#y#thing more till the pi#geon had fin#ished as if it wasn t trou#ble e#nough hatch#ing the eggs sa#id the pi#geon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day why i ha#ven t had a wink of sleep these three week#e i m ver#y sor#ry you ve been an#noy#n sa#id alice who was be#gin#ning to see its mean#ing and just as i d tak#en the highest tree in the wood con#tin#ued the pi#geon rais#ing its voice to a shriek and just as i was think#ing i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh ser#pent but i m not a ser#pent i tell you sa#id alice i m a i m a well what are you sa#id the pi#geon i can see you re try#ing to in#vent some#thing i i m a lit#tle girl sa#id alice ra#ther doubt#ful#ly as she remembered the num#ber of changes she had gone through that day a like#ly sto#ry in#deed sa#id the pi#geon in a tone of the deepest con#tempt i ve seen a good man#y lit#tle girl#i in my time but nev#er one with such a neck as that no no you re a ser#pent and there s no use de#ny#ing it i sup#pose you ll be tell#ing me next that you nev#er tast#ed an egg i have tast#ed eggs cer#tain#ly sa#id alice who was a ver#y truth#ful child but lit#tle girl#i eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you know i don t be#lieve it sa#id the pi#geon but if they do why then they re a kind of ser#pent that s all i can say this was such a new i#de#a to alice that she was quite si#lent for a mi#nute or two which gave the pi#geon the opportunity of adding you re look#k for eggs i know that well e#nough and what does it mat#ter to me wheth#er you re a lit#tle girl or a ser#pent it mat#e a good deal to me sa#id alice hast#i#ly but i m not look#k for eggs as it hap#e and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them raw well be off then sa#id the pi#geon in a sulk#y tone as it settled down a#gain in#to its nest alice crouch#o down a#mong the trees as well as she could for her neck kept get#ting entangled a#mong the branch#a and eve#ry now and then she had to stop and untwist it af#ter a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mush#room in her hands and she set to work ver#y care#ful#ly nibbling first at one and then at the oth#er and grow#ing some#times taller and some#times short#o un#til she had suc#cess#c in bring#ing her#self down to her u#su#al height it was so long since she had been an#y#thing near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few min#utes and be#gan talk#k to her#self as u#su#al come there s half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are i m nev#er sure what i m go#ing to be from one mi#nute to an#oth#er how#ev#er i ve got back to my right size the next thing i#s to get in#to that beau#ti#ful gar#den how i#s that to be done i won#der as she sa#id this she came sud#den#ly up#on an o#pen place with a lit#tle house in it a#bout four feet high who#ev#er lives there thought alice it ll nev#er do to come up#on them this size why i should fright#en them out of their wits so she be#gan nibbling at the righthand bit a#gain and did not ven#ture to go near the house till she had brought her#self down to nine inch#c high chap#ter vi pig and pep#per for a mi#nute or two she stood look#k at the house and won#der#ing what to do next when sud#den#ly a foot#man in liv#er#y came run#ning out of the wood she con#sid#ered him to be a foot#man be#cause he was in liv#er#y oth#er#wise judg#ing by his face on#ly she would have called him a fish and rap#p loud#ly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by an#oth#er foot#man in liv#er#y with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice no#ticed had powdered hair that curl#r all o#ver their heads she felt ver#y cu#ri#ous to know what it was all a#bout and crept a lit#tle way out of the wood to lis#ten the fish foot#man be#gan by pro#duc#ing from un#der his arm a great let#ter near#ly as large as him#self and this he hand#ed o#ver to the oth#er say#ing in a sol#emn tone for the duch#ess an in#vi#ta#tion from the queen to play cro#quet the frog foot#man re#peat#ed in the same sol#emn tone on#ly chang#ing the or#der of the words a lit#tle from the queen an in#vi#ta#tion for the duch#ess to play cro#quet then they both bow#w low and their curl#u got entangled to#geth#er alice laugh#u so much at this that she had to run back in#to the wood for fear of their hear#ing her and when she next peep#e out the fish foot#man was gone and the oth#er was sit#ting on the ground near the door star#ing stu#pid#ly up in#to the sky alice went tim#id#ly up to the door and knock#o there s no sort of use in knock#c sa#id the foot#man and that for two rea#son#e first be#cause i m on the same side of the door as you are sec#ond#ly be#cause they re mak#ing such a noise in#side no one could pos#si#bly hear you and cer#tain#ly there was a most ex#traor#di#nar#y noise go#ing on with#in a con#stant howl#ing and sneez#ing and eve#ry now and then a great crash as if a dish or ket#tle had been bro#ken to pieces please then sa#id alice how a#m i to get in there might be some sense in your knock#c the foot#man went on with#out at#tend#ing to her if we had the door be#tween us for in#stance if you were in#side you might knock and i could let you out you know he was look#k up in#to the sky all the time he was speak#ing and this alice thought de#cid#ed#ly un#civ#il but per#haps he can t help it she sa#id to her#self his eyes are so ver#y near#ly at the top of his head but at an#y rate he might an#swer quest#t how a#m i to get in she re#peat#ed a#loud i shall sit he#re the foot#man re#mark#m till to#mor#row at this mo#ment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skim#ming out straight at the foot#man s head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces a#gainst one of the trees be#hind him or next day may#be the foot#man con#tin#ued in the same tone ex#act#ly as if noth#ing had hap#n how a#m i to get in ask#k alice a#gain in a loud#u tone are you to get in at all sa#id the foot#man that s the first ques#tion you know it was no doubt on#ly alice did not like to be told so it s re#al#ly dread#ful she muttered to her#self the way all the creatures ar#gue it s e#nough to drive one cra#zy the foot#man seem#e to think this a good opportunity for rep#i his re#mark with var#y#i i shall sit he#re he sa#id on and off for days and days but what a#m i to do sa#id alice an#y#thing you like sa#id the foot#man and be#gan whis#tling oh there s no use in talk#k to him sa#id alice desperately he s per#fect#ly id#i#ot#ic and she opened the door and went in the door led right in#to a large kitch#en which was full of smoke from one end to the oth#er the duch#ess was sit#ting on a three leg#ged stool in the mid#dle nursing a ba#by the cook was lean#ing o#ver the fire stir#ring a large caul#dron which seem#e to be full of soup there s cer#tain#ly too much pep#per in that soup alice sa#id to her#self as well as she could for sneez#ing there was cer#tain#ly too much of it in the a#ir e#ven the duch#ess sneezed occasionally and as for the ba#by it was sneez#ing and howl#ing alternately with#out a mo#ment s pause the on#ly thing#h in the kitch#en that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sit#ting on the hearth and grin#ning from ear to ear please would you tell me sa#id alice a lit#tle tim#id#ly for she was not quite sure wheth#er it was good man#ners for her to speak first why your cat grin#r like that it s a chesh#ire cat sa#id the duch#ess and that s why pig she sa#id the last word with such sud#den vi#o#lence that alice quite jump#m but she saw in an#oth#er mo#ment that it was ad#dress#d to the ba#by and not to her so she took cour#age and went on a#gain i didn t know that chesh#ire cat#a al#ways grin#n in fact i didn t know that cat#a could grin they all can sa#id the duch#ess and most of em do i don t know of an#y that do alice sa#id ver#y po#lite#ly feel#ing quite pleas#e to have got in#to a con#ver#sa#tion you don t know much sa#id the duch#ess and that s a fact alice did not at all like the tone of this re#mark and thought it would be as well to in#tro#duce some oth#er sub#ject of con#ver#sa#tion while she was try#ing to fix on one the cook took the caul#dron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing eve#ry#thing with#in her reach at the duch#ess and the ba#by the fire i#rons came first then fol#low#l a show#er of saucepans plat#a and dish#s the duch#ess took no no#tice of them e#ven when they hit her and the ba#by was howl#ing so much al#read#y that it was quite im#pos#si#ble to say wheth#er the b#low#l hurt it or not oh please mind what you re do#ing cried alice jump#p up and down in an ag#o#ny of ter#ror oh there goes his pre#cious nose as an un#u#su#al#ly large sauce#pan flew close by it and ver#y near#ly car#ried it off if eve#ry#bod#y mind#ed their own busi#ness the duch#ess sa#id in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal fast#s than it does which would not be an ad#van#tage sa#id alice who felt ver#y glad to get an opportunity of show#ing off a lit#tle of her knowl#edge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twen#ty four hours to turn round on its ax#is talk#k of ax#es sa#id the duch#ess chop off her head alice glanced ra#ther anx#ious#ly at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was bus#i#ly stir#ring the soup and seem#e not to be list#n so she went on a#gain twen#ty four hours i think or i#s it twelve i oh don t both#er me sa#id the duch#ess i nev#er could a#bide fig#r and with that she be#gan nursing her child a#gain sing#ing a sort of lull#a#by to it as she did so and giv#ing it a vi#o#lent shake at the end of eve#ry line speak rough#ly to your lit#tle boy and beat him when he sneezes he on#ly does it to an#noy be#cause he know#n it teases cho#rus in which the cook and the ba#by join#i wow wow wow while the duch#ess sang the se#cond verse of the song she kept toss#s the ba#by vi#ol#n up and down and the poor lit#tle thing howl#w so that alice could hard#ly hear the words i speak se#vere#ly to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thor#ough#ly en#joy the pep#per when he pleas#e cho#rus wow wow wow he#re you may nurse it a bit if you like the duch#ess sa#id to alice fling#ing the ba#by at her as she spoke i must go and get read#y to play cro#quet with the queen and she hur#ried out of the room the cook threw a fry#ing pan af#ter her as she went out but it just miss#s her alice caught the ba#by with some dif#fi#cul#ty as it was a queer shaped lit#tle crea#ture and held out its arms and leg#e in all di#rec#tions just like a star fish thought alice the poor lit#tle thing was snort#r like a steam en#gine when she caught it and kept dou#bling it#self up and straightening it#self out a#gain so that al#to#geth#er for the first mi#nute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it as soon as she had made out the prop#er way of nursing it which was to twist it up in#to a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to pre#vent its un#do#ing it#self she car#ried it out in#to the o#pen a#ir if i don t take this child a#way with me thought alice they re sure to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be mur#der to leave it be#hind she sa#id the last words out loud and the lit#tle thing grunt#u in re#ply it had left off sneez#ing by this time don t grunt sa#id alice that s not at all a prop#er way of ex#press#r your#self the ba#by grunt#u a#gain and alice look#o ver#y anx#ious#ly in#to its face to see what was the mat#ter with it there could be no doubt that it had a ver#y turn up nose much more like a snout than a re#al nose al#so its eyes were get#ting ex#treme#ly small for a ba#by al#to#geth#er alice did not like the look of the thing at all but per#haps it was on#ly sob#bing she thought and look#o in#to its eyes a#gain to see if there were an#y tears no there were no tears if you re go#ing to turn in#to a pig my dear sa#id alice se#ri#ous#ly i ll have noth#ing more to do with you mind now the poor lit#tle thing sob#b a#gain or grunt#u it was im#pos#si#ble to say which and they went on for some while in si#lence alice was just be#gin#ning to think to her#self now what a#m i to do with this crea#ture when i get it home when it grunt#u a#gain so vi#ol#n that she look#o down in#to its face in some a#larm this time there could be no mis#take a#bout it it was nei#ther more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite ab#surd for her to car#ry it fur#ther so she set the lit#tle crea#ture down and felt quite re#lieved to see it trot a#way qui#et#ly in#to the wood if it had grown up she sa#id to her#self it would have made a dread#ful#ly ug#ly child but it makes ra#ther a hand#some pig i think and she be#gan think#ing o#ver oth#er chil#dren she knew who might do ver#y well as pigs and was just say#ing to her#self if one on#ly knew the right way to change them when she was a lit#tle startled by see#ing the chesh#ire cat sit#ting on a bough of a tree a few yard#a off the cat on#ly grin#n when it saw alice it look#o good natured she thought still it had ver#y long claw#l and a great man#y teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with re#spect chesh#ire puss she be#gan ra#ther tim#id#ly as she did not at all know wheth#er it would like the name how#ev#er it on#ly grin#n a lit#tle wid#er come it s pleas#e so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from he#re that de#pend#e a good deal on where you want to get to sa#id the cat i don t much care where sa#id alice then it doesn t mat#ter which way you go sa#id the cat so long as i get some#where alice added as an ex#pla#na#tion oh you re sure to do that sa#id the cat if you on#ly walk long e#nough alice felt that this could not be de#nied so she tried an#oth#er ques#tion what sort of peo#ple live a#bout he#re in that di#rec#tion the cat sa#id wav#ing its right paw round lives a hat#ter and in that di#rec#tion wav#ing the oth#er paw lives a march hare vis#it ei#ther you like they re both mad but i don t want to go a#mong mad peo#ple alice re#mark#m oh you can t help that sa#id the cat we re all mad he#re i m mad you re mad how do you know i m mad sa#id alice you must be sa#id the cat or you wouldn t have come he#re alice didn t think that proved it at all how#ev#er she went on and how do you know that you re mad to be#gin with sa#id the cat a dog s not mad you grant that i sup#pose so sa#id alice well then the cat went on you see a dog growl#r when it s an#gry and wag#a its tail when it s pleas#e now i growl when i m pleas#e and wag my tail when i m an#gry there#fore i m mad i call it purring not growl#w sa#id alice call it what you like sa#id the cat do you play cro#quet with the queen to day i should like it ver#y much sa#id alice but i ha#ven t been in#vit#ed yet you ll see me there sa#id the cat and van#h alice was not much sur#prised at this she was get#ting so used to queer thing#h hap#pen#ing while she was look#k at the place where it had been it sud#den#ly ap#pear#p a#gain by the bye what be#came of the ba#by sa#id the cat i d near#ly for#got#ten to ask it turn#r in#to a pig alice qui#et#ly sa#id just as if it had come back in a nat#u#ral way i thought it would sa#id the cat and van#h a#gain alice wait#i a lit#tle half ex#pect#ing to see it a#gain but it did not ap#pear and af#ter a mi#nute or two she walk#l on in the di#rec#tion in which the march hare was sa#id to live i ve seen hat#e be#fore she sa#id to her#self the march hare will be much the most in#ter#est#ing and per#haps as this i#s may it won t be rav#ing mad at least not so mad as it was in march as she sa#id this she look#o up and there was the cat a#gain sit#ting on a branch of a tree did you say pig or fig sa#id the cat i sa#id pig re#ply#p alice and i wish you wouldn t keep ap#pear#e and van#i so sud#den#ly you make one quite gid#dy all right sa#id the cat and this time it van#h quite slow#ly be#gin#ning with the end of the tail and end#ing with the grin which re#main#m some time af#ter the rest of it had gone well i ve of#ten seen a cat with#out a grin thought alice but a grin with#out a cat it s the most cu#ri#ous thing i ev#er saw in my life she had not gone much far#ther be#fore she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house be#cause the chim#ney#h were shaped like ear#a and the roof was thatch#a with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go near#a till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mush#room and raised her#self to a#bout two feet high e#ven then she walk#l up to#ward#o it ra#ther tim#id#ly say#ing to her#self sup#pose it should be rav#ing mad af#ter all i al#most wish i d gone to see the hat#ter in#stead chap#ter vii a mad tea par#ty there was a ta#ble set out un#der a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hat#ter were hav#ing tea at it a dor#mouse was sit#ting be#tween them fast a#sleep and the oth#er two were us#ing it as a cush#ion re#sting their el#bow#l on it and talk#k o#ver its head ver#y uncomfortable for the dor#mouse thought alice on#ly as it s a#sleep i sup#pose it doesn t mind the ta#ble was a large one but the three were all crowd#ed to#geth#er at one cor#ner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice com#ing there s plen#ty of room sa#id alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one end of the ta#ble have some wine the march hare sa#id in an encouraging tone alice look#o all round the ta#ble but there was noth#ing on it but tea i don t see an#y wine she re#mark#m there isn t an#y sa#id the march hare then it wasn t ver#y civ#il of you to of#fer it sa#id alice an#gri#ly it wasn t ver#y civ#il of you to sit down with#out be#ing in#vit#ed sa#id the march hare i didn t know it was your ta#ble sa#id alice it s laid for a great man#y more than three your hair want#a cut#ting sa#id the hat#ter he had been look#k at alice for some time with great cu#ri#os#i#ty and this was his first speech you should learn not to make per#son#al re#mark#e alice sa#id with some se#ver#i#ty it s ver#y rude the hat#ter opened his eyes ver#y wide on hear#ing this but all he sa#id was why i#s a ra#ven like a writ#ing desk come we shall have some fun now thought alice i m glad they ve be#gun ask#i riddles i be#lieve i can guess that she added a#loud do you mean that you think you can find out the an#swer to it sa#id the march hare ex#act#ly so sa#id alice then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hast#i#ly re#ply#p at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know not the same thing a bit sa#id the hat#ter you might just as well say that i see what i eat i#s the same thing as i eat what i see you might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get i#s the same thing as i get what i like you might just as well say added the dor#mouse who seem#e to be talk#k in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep i#s the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it i#s the same thing with you sa#id the hat#ter and he#re the con#ver#sa#tion drop#p and the par#ty sat si#lent for a mi#nute while alice thought o#ver all she could re#mem#ber a#bout ravens and writ#ing desk#e which wasn t much the hat#ter was the first to break the si#lence what day of the month i#s it he sa#id turn#ing to alice he had tak#en his watch out of his pock#et and was look#k at it un#eas#i#ly shak#ing it eve#ry now and then and hold#ing it to his ear alice con#sid#ered a lit#tle and then sa#id the fourth two days wrong sigh#g the hat#ter i told you but#ter wouldn t suit the works he added look#k an#gri#ly at the march hare it was the best but#ter the march hare meek#ly re#ply#p yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hat#ter grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread knife the march hare took the watch and look#o at it gloom#i#ly then he dip#p it in#to his cup of tea and look#o at it a#gain but he could think of noth#ing bet#ter to say than his first re#mark it was the best but#ter you know alice had been look#k o#ver his shoul#der with some cu#ri#os#i#ty what a fun#ny watch she re#mark#m it tells the day of the month and doesn t tell what o clock it i#s why should it muttered the hat#ter does your watch tell you what year it i#s of course not alice re#ply#p ver#y read#i#ly but that s be#cause it stays the same year for such a long time to#geth#er which i#s just the case with mine sa#id the hat#ter alice felt dread#ful#ly puzzled the hat#ter s re#mark seem#e to have no sort of mean#ing in it and yet it was cer#tain#ly eng#lish i don t quite un#der#stand you she sa#id as po#lite#ly as she could the dor#mouse i#s a#sleep a#gain sa#id the hat#ter and he pour#u a lit#tle hot tea up#on its nose the dor#mouse shook its head impatiently and sa#id with#out o#pen#ing its eyes of course of course just what i was go#ing to re#mark my#self have you guess#e the rid#dle yet the hat#ter sa#id turn#ing to alice a#gain no i give it up alice re#ply#p what s the an#swer i ha#ven t the slightest i#de#a sa#id the hat#ter nor i sa#id the march hare alice sigh#g wea#ri#ly i think you might do some#thing bet#ter with the time she sa#id than waste it in ask#i riddles that have no answers if you knew time as well as i do sa#id the hat#ter you wouldn t talk a#bout wast#ing it it s him i don t know what you mean sa#id alice of course you don t the hat#ter sa#id toss#s his head contemptuously i dare say you nev#er e#ven spoke to time per#haps not alice cau#tious#ly re#ply#p but i know i have to beat time when i learn mu#sic ah that ac#count#c for it sa#id the hat#ter he won t stand beat#ing now if you on#ly kept on good terms with him he d do al#most an#y#thing you liked with the clock for in#stance sup#pose it were nine o clock in the morn#ing just time to be#gin les#son#e you d on#ly have to whis#per a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twin#kling half past one time for din#ner i on#ly wish it was the march hare sa#id to it#self in a whis#per that would be grand cer#tain#ly sa#id alice thought#h but then i shouldn t be hun#gry for it you know not at first per#haps sa#id the hat#ter but you could keep it to half past one as long as you liked i#s that the way you man#age alice ask#k the hat#ter shook his head mourn#f not i he re#ply#p we quar#relled last march just be#fore he went mad you know point#ing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great con#cert giv#en by the queen of hearts and i had to sing twin#kle twin#kle lit#tle bat how i won#der what you re at you know the song per#haps i ve heard some#thing like it sa#id alice it goes on you know the hat#ter con#tin#ued in this

and the dor#mouse fol#low#l him the march hare moved in#to the dor#mouse s place and alice ra#ther unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hat#ter was the on#ly one who got an#y ad#van#tage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than be#fore as the march hare had just up#set the milk jug in#to his plate alice did not wish to of#fend the dor#mouse a#gain so she be#gan ver#y cau#tious#ly but i don t un#der#stand where did they draw the treacle from you can draw wa#ter out of a wa#ter well sa#id the hat#ter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh

this piece of rude#ness was more than alice could bear she got up in great dis#gust and walk#l off the dor#mouse fell a#sleep in#stant#ly and nei#ther of the others took the least no#tice of her go#ing though she look#o back once or twice half hop#ing that they would call af#ter her the last time she saw them they were try#ing to put the dor#mouse in#to the tea#pot at an#y rate i ll nev#er go there a#gain sa#id alice as she pick#ed her way through the wood it s the stupidest tea par#ty i ev#er was at in all my life just as she sa#id this she no#ticed that one of the trees had a door lead#ing right in#to it that s ver#y cu#ri#ous she thought but eve#ry#thing s cu#ri#ous to#day i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found her#self in the long hall and close to the lit#tle glass ta#ble now i ll man#age bet#ter this time she sa#id to her#self and be#gan by tak#ing the lit#tle gold#en key and un#lock#o the door that led in#to the gar#den then she went to work nibbling at the mush#room she had kept a piece of it in her pock#et till she was a#bout a foot high then she walk#l down the lit#tle pas#sage and then she found her#self at last in the beau#ti#ful gar#den a#mong the bright flow#er beds and the cool foun#tain#o chap#ter viii the queen s cro#quet ground a large rose tree stood near the en#trance of the gar#den the roses grow#ing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it bus#i#ly paint#ing them red alice thought this a ver#y cu#ri#ous thing and she went near#a to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one

sa#id alice a lit#tle tim#id#ly why you are paint#ing those roses five and sev#en sa#id noth#ing but look#o at two two be#gan in a low voice why the fact i#s you see miss this he#re ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mis#take and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss we re do#ing our best afore she co#mes to at this mo#ment five who had been anx#ious#ly look#k a#cross the gar#den called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners in#stant#ly threw them#selves flat up#on their faces there was a sound of man#y foot#step#o and alice look#o round ea#ger to see the queen first came ten soldiers car#ry#ing club#l these were all shaped like the three gardeners ob#long and flat with their hands and feet at the corn#n next the ten courtiers these were or#na#ment#ed all o#ver with di#a#mond#i and walk#l two and two as the soldiers did af#ter these came the roy#al chil#dren there were ten of them and the

crim#son vel#vet cush#ion and last of all this grand pro#ces#sion came the king and queen of hearts alice was ra#ther doubt#ful wheth#er she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not re#mem#ber ev#er hav#ing heard of such a rule at pro#cess#e and be#sides what would be the use of a pro#ces#sion thought she if peo#ple had all to lie down up#on their faces so that they couldn t see it so she stood still where she was and wait#i when the pro#ces#sion came op#po#site to alice they all stopped and look#o at her and the queen sa#id se#vere#ly who i#s this she sa#id it to the knave of hearts who on#ly bow#w and smiled in re#ply id#i#ot sa#id the queen toss#s her head impatiently and turn#ing to alice she went on what s your name child my name i#s alice so please your maj#es#ty sa#id alice ver#y po#lite#ly but she added to her#self why they re on#ly a pack of cards af#ter all i needn t be a#fraid of them and who are these sa#id the queen point#ing to the three gardeners who were ly#ing round the rosetree for you see as they were ly#ing on their faces and the pat#tern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell wheth#er they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own chil#dren how should i know sa#id alice sur#prised at her own cour#age it s no busi#ness of mine the queen turn#r crim#son with fu#ry and af#ter glar#ing at her for a mo#ment like a wild beast screamed off with her head off non#sense sa#id alice ver#y loud#ly and de#cid#ed#ly and the queen was si#lent the king laid his hand up#on her arm and

make me gid#dy and then turn#ing to the rose tree she went on what have you been do#ing he#re may it please your maj#es#ty sa#id two in a ver#y hum#ble tone go#ing down on one knee as he spoke we were try#ing i see sa#id the queen who had mean#while been ex#am#in#ing the roses off with their heads and the pro#ces#sion moved on three of the soldiers re#main#a be#hind to ex#e#cute the un#for#tu#nate gardeners who ran to alice for pro#tec#tion you shan t be be#head#h sa#id alice and she put them in#to a large flow#er pot that stood near the three soldiers wand#e a#bout for a mi#nute or two look#k for them and then qui#et#ly march#r off af#ter the others are their heads off shout#o the queen their heads are gone if it please your maj#es#ty the soldiers shout#o in re#ply that s right shout#o the

pro#ces#sion won#der#ing ver#y much what would hap#pen next it s it s a ver#y fi#ne day sa#id a tim#id voice at her side she was walk#ing by the white rab#bit who was peep#p anx#ious#ly in#to her face ver#y sa#id alice where s the duch#ess hush hush sa#id the rab#bit in a low hur#ried tone he look#o anx#ious#ly o#ver his shoul#der as he spoke and then raised him#self up#on tip#toe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered she s un#der sen#tence of ex#e#cu#tion what for sa#id alice did you say what a pit#y the rab#bit ask#k no i didn t sa#id alice i don t think it s at all a pit#y i sa#id what for she box#x the queen s ear#a the rab#bit be#gan alice gave a lit#tle scream of laugh#ter oh hush the rab#bit whispered in a fright#ened tone the queen will hear you you see she came ra#ther late and the queen sa#id get to your places shout#o the queen in a voice of thun#der and peo#ple be#gan run#ning a#bout in all di#rec#tions tum#bling up a#gainst each oth#er how#ev#er they got settled down in a mi#nute or two and the game be#gan alice thought she had nev#er seen such a cu#ri#ous cro#quet ground in her life it was all ridges and fur#row#u the balls were live hedge#hog#e the mal#let#a live fla#min#go#a and the soldiers had to dou#ble them#selves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arch#es the chief dif#fi#cul#ty alice found at first was in man#ag#ing her fla#min#go she suc#cess#c in get#ting its bod#y tuck#c a#way com#fort#o e#nough un#der her arm with its leg#e hang#ing down but gen#er#al#ly just as she had got its neck nice#ly straightened out and was go#ing to give the hedge#hog a b#low with its head it would twist it#self round and look up in her face with such a puzzled ex#pres#sion that she could not help burst#ing out laugh#ing and when she had got its head down and was go#ing to be#gin a#gain it was ver#y pro#vok#ing to find that the hedge#hog had unrolled it#self and was in the act of crawl#w a#way be#sides all this there was gen#er#al#ly a ridge or fur#row in the way wher#ev#er she want#n to send the hedge#hog to and as the doubled up soldiers were al#ways get#ting up and walk#ing off to oth#er parts of the ground alice soon came to the con#clu#sion that it was a ver#y dif#fi#cult game in#deed the play#y all play#a at once with#out wait#t for turn#u quar#rel#r all the while and fight#ing for the hedge#hog#e and in a ver#y short time the queen was in a fu#ri#ous pas#sion and went stamp#m a#bout and shout#u off with his head or off with her head a#bout once in a mi#nute alice be#gan to feel ver#y un#eas#y to be sure she had not as yet had an#y dis#pute with the queen but she knew that it might hap#pen an#y mi#nute and then thought she what would be#come of me they re dread#ful#ly fond of be#head#e peo#ple he#re the great won#der i#s that there s an#y one left a#live she was look#k a#bout for some way of es#cape and won#der#ing wheth#er she could get a#way with#out be#ing seen when she no#ticed a cu#ri#ous ap#pear#ance in the a#ir it puzzled her ver#y much at first but af#ter watch#c it a mi#nute or two she made it out to be a grin and she sa#id to her#self it s the chesh#ire cat now i shall have some#bod#y to talk to how are you get#ting on sa#id the cat as soon as there was mouth e#nough for it to speak with alice wait#i till the eyes ap#pear#p and then nod#ded it s no use speak#ing to it she thought till its ear#a have come or at least one of them in an#oth#er mi#nute the whole head ap#pear#p and then alice put down her fla#min#go and be#gan an ac#count of the game feel#ing ver#y glad she had some#one to lis#ten to her the cat seem#e to think that there was e#nough of it now in sight and no more of it ap#pear#p i don t think they play at all fair#ly alice be#gan in ra#ther a com#plain#p tone and they all quar#rel so dread#ful#ly one can t hear one#self speak and they don t seem to have an#y rules in par#tic#u#lar at least if there are no#bod#y at#tend#t to them and you ve no i#de#a how con#fus#ing it i#s all the thing#h be#ing a#live for in#stance there s the arch i ve got to go through next walk#ing a#bout at the oth#er end of the ground and i should have cro#quet#o the queen s hedge#hog just now on#ly it ran a#way when it saw mine com#ing how do you like the queen sa#id the cat in a low voice not at all sa#id alice she s so ex#treme#ly just then she no#ticed that the queen was close be#hind her list#n so she went on like#ly to win that it s hard#ly worth while fin#i the game the queen smiled and passed on who are you talk#k to sa#id the king go#ing up to alice and look#k at the cat s head with great cu#ri#os#i#ty it s a friend of mine a chesh#ire cat sa#id alice al#low me to in#tro#duce it i don t like the look of it at all sa#id the king how#ev#er it may kiss my hand if it likes i d ra#ther not the cat re#mark#m don t be im#per#ti#nent sa#id the king and don t look at me like that he got be#hind alice as he spoke a cat may look at a king sa#id alice i ve read that in some book but i don t re#mem#ber where well it must be re#moved sa#id the king ver#y de#cid#ed#ly and he called the queen who was pass#ing at the mo#ment my dear i wish you would have this cat re#moved the queen had on#ly one way of set#tling all difficulties great or small off with his head she sa#id with#out e#ven look#k round i ll fetch the executioner my#self sa#id the king ea#ger#ly and he hur#ried off alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was go#ing on as she heard the queen s voice in the dis#tance screaming with pas#sion she had al#read#y heard her sen#tence three of the play#y to be ex#e#cut#ed for hav#ing miss#s their turn#u and she did not like the look of thing#h at all as the game was in such con#fu#sion that she nev#er knew wheth#er it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedge#hog the hedge#hog was en#gaged in a fight with an#oth#er hedge#hog which seem#e to alice an ex#cel#lent opportunity for cro#quet#q one of them with the oth#er the on#ly dif#fi#cul#ty was that her fla#min#go was gone a#cross to the oth#er side of the gar#den where alice could see it try#ing in a help#less sort of way to fly up in#to a tree by the time she had caught the fla#min#go and brought it back the fight was o#ver and both the hedge#hog#e were out of sight but it doesn t mat#ter much thought alice as all the arch#es are gone from this side of the ground so she tuck#c it a#way un#der her arm that it might not es#cape a#gain and went back for a lit#tle more con#ver#sa#tion with her friend when she got back to the chesh#ire cat she was sur#prised to find quite a large crowd col#lect#ed round it there was a dis#pute go#ing on be#tween the executioner the king and the queen who were all talk#k at once while all the rest were quite si#lent and look#o ver#y uncomfortable the mo#ment alice ap#pear#p she was appealed to by all three to set#tle the ques#tion and they re#peat#ed their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it ver#y hard in#deed to make out ex#act#ly what they sa#id the executioner s ar#gu#ment was that you couldn t cut off a head un#less there was a bod#y to cut it off from that he had nev#er had to do such a thing be#fore and he wasn t go#ing to be#gin at his time of life the king s ar#gu#ment was that an#y#thing that had a head could be be#head#h and that you weren t to talk non#sense the queen s ar#gu#ment was that if some#thing wasn t done a#bout it in less than no time she d have eve#ry#bod#y ex#e#cut#ed all round it was this last re#mark that had made the whole par#ty look so gra#ve and anx#ious alice could think of noth#ing else to say but it be#long#e to the duch#ess you d bet#ter ask her a#bout it she s in pris#on the queen sa#id to the executioner fetch her he#re and the executioner went off like an ar#row the cat s head be#gan fad#ing a#way the mo#ment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duch#ess it had en#tire#ly dis#ap#pear#s so the king and the executioner ran wild#ly up and down look#k for it while the rest of the par#ty went back to the game chap#ter ix the mock tur#tle s sto#ry you can t think how glad i a#m to see you a#gain you dear old thing sa#id the duch#ess as she tuck#c her arm af#fect#n in#to alice s and they walk#l off to#geth#er alice was ver#y glad to find her in such a pleas#ant tem#per and thought to her#self that per#haps it was on#ly the pep#per that had made her so sav#age when they met in the kitch#en when i m a duch#ess she sa#id to her#self not in a ver#y hope#ful tone though i won t have an#y pep#per in my kitch#en at all soup does ver#y well with#out may#be it s al#ways pep#per that makes peo#ple hot tem#pered she went on ver#y much pleas#e at hav#ing found out a new kind of rule and vin#e#gar that makes them sour and cam#o#mile that makes them bit#ter and and bar#ley sug#ar and such thing#h that make chil#dren sweet tem#pered i on#ly wish peo#ple knew that then they wouldn t be so stin#gy a#bout it you know she had quite for#got#ten the duch#ess by this time and was a lit#tle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear you re think#ing a#bout some#thing my dear and that makes you for#get to talk i can t tell you just now what the mor#al of that i#s but i shall re#mem#ber it in a bit per#haps it hasn t one alice ven#tured to re#mark tut tut child sa#id the duch#ess eve#ry#thing s got a mor#al if on#ly you can find it and she squeezed her#self up clos#er to alice s side as she spoke alice did not much like keep#ing so close to her first be#cause the duch#ess was ver#y ug#ly and sec#ond#ly be#cause she was ex#act#ly the right height to rest her chin up#on alice s shoul#der and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin how#ev#er she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could the game s go#ing on ra#ther bet#ter now she sa#id by way of keep#ing up the con#ver#sa#tion a lit#tle tis so sa#id the duch#ess and the mor#al of that i#s oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round some#bod#y sa#id alice whispered that it s done by eve#ry#bod#y mind#d their own busi#ness ah well it means much the same thing sa#id the duch#ess dig#ging her sharp lit#tle chin in#to alice s shoul#der as she added and the mor#al of that i#s take care of the sense and the sound#o will take care of them#selves how fond she i#s of find#ing morals in thing#h alice thought to her#self i dare say you re won#der#ing why i don t put my arm round your waist the duch#ess sa#id af#ter a pause the rea#son i#s that i m doubt#ful a#bout the tem#per of your fla#min#go shall i try the ex#per#i#ment he might bite alice cau#tious#ly re#ply#p not feel#ing at all anx#ious to have the ex#per#i#ment tried ver#y true sa#id the duch#ess fla#min#go#a and mus#tard both bite and the mor#al of that i#s bird#i of a feath#er flock to#geth#er on#ly mus#tard isn t a bird alice re#mark#m right as u#su#al sa#id the duch#ess what a clear way you have of put#ting thing#h it s a min#er#al i think sa#id alice of course it i#s sa#id the duch#ess who seem#e read#y to a#gree to eve#ry#thing that alice sa#id there s a large mus#tard mine near he#re and the mor#al of that i#s the more there i#s of mine the less there i#s of yours oh i know ex#claim#c alice who had not at#tend#t to this last re#mark it s a veg#e#ta#ble it doesn t look like one but it i#s i quite a#gree with you sa#id the duch#ess and the mor#al of that i#s be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more sim#ply nev#er im#ag#ine your#self not to be oth#er#wise than what it might ap#pear to others that what you were or might have been was not oth#er#wise than what you had been would have ap#pear#p to them to be oth#er#wise i think i should un#der#stand that bet#ter alice sa#id ver#y po#lite#ly if i had it writ#ten down but i can t quite fol#low it as you say it that s noth#ing to what i could say if i chose the duch#ess re#ply#p in a pleas#e tone pray don t trou#ble your#self to say it an#y long#er than that sa#id alice oh don t talk a#bout trou#ble sa#id the duch#ess i make you a pre#sent of eve#ry#thing i ve sa#id as yet a cheap sort of pre#sent thought alice i m glad they don t give birth#day pres#ents like that but she did not ven#ture to say it out loud think#ing a#gain the duch#ess ask#k with an#oth#er dig of her sharp lit#tle chin i ve a right to think sa#id alice sharp#ly for she was be#gin#ning to feel a lit#tle wor#ried just a#bout as much right sa#id the duch#ess as pigs have to fly and the m but he#re to alice s great sur#prise the duch#ess s voice died a#way e#ven in the mid#dle of her favourite word mor#al and the arm that was linked in#to hers be#gan to trem#ble alice look#o up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms fold#l frown#w like a thun#der#storm a fi#ne day your maj#es#ty the duch#ess be#gan in a low weak voice now i give you fair warn#ing shout#o the queen stamp#m on the ground as she spoke ei#ther you or your head must be off and that in a#bout half no time take your choice the duch#ess took her choice and was gone in a mo#ment let s go on with the game the queen sa#id to alice and alice was too much fright#ened to say a word but slow#ly fol#low#l her back to the cro#quet ground the oth#er guest#u had tak#en ad#van#tage of the queen s ab#sence and were re#sting in the shade how#ev#er the mo#ment they saw her they hur#ried back to the game the queen mere#ly re#mark#a that a mo#ment s de#lay would cost them their lives all the time they were play#y the queen nev#er left off quar#rel#r with the oth#er play#y and shout#u off with his head or off with her head those whom she sen#tenced were tak#en in#to cus#to#dy by the soldiers who of course had to leave off be#ing arch#es to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arch#es left and all the play#y ex#cept the king the queen and alice were in cus#to#dy and un#der sen#tence of ex#e#cu#tion then the queen left off quite out of breath and sa#id to alice have you seen the mock tur#tle yet no sa#id alice i don t e#ven know what a mock tur#tle i#s it s the thing mock tur#tle soup i#s made

exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryph#on and the con#stant heav#y sob#bing of the mock tur#tle alice was ver#y near#ly get#ting up and say#ing thank you sir for your in#ter#est#ing sto#ry but she could not help think#ing there must be more to come so she sat still and sa#id noth#ing when we were lit#tle the mock tur#tle went on at last more calm#ly though still sob#bing a lit#tle now and then we went to school in the sea the mas#ter was an old tur#tle we used to call him tor#toise why did you call him tor#toise if he wasn t one alice ask#k we called him tor#toise be#cause he taught us sa#id the mock tur#tle an#gri#ly re#al#ly you are ver#y dull you ought to be a#shamed of your#self for ask#i such a sim#ple ques#tion added the gryph#on and then they both sat si#lent and look#o at

till she got to the part a#bout her rep#i you are old fa#ther wil#liam to the cat#er#pil#lar and the words all com#ing dif#fer#ent and then the mock tur#tle drew a long breath and sa#id that s ver#y cu#ri#ous it s all a#bout as cu#ri#ous as it can be sa#id the gryph#on it all came dif#fer#ent the mock tur#tle re#peat#ed thought#h i should like to hear her try and re#peat some#thing now tell her

a#bout and make one re#peat les#son#e thought alice i might as well be at school at once how#ev#er she got up and be#gan to re#peat it but her head was so full of the lob#ster qua#drille that she hard#ly knew what she was say#ing and the words came ver#y queer in#deed tis the voice of the lob#ster i heard him de#clare you have baked me too brown i must sug#ar my hair as a duck with its eye#lid#y so he with his nose trim#r his belt and his but#tons and turn#u out his toe#o lat#er ed#it#i con#tin#ued as fol#low#o when the sand#a are all dry he i#s gay as a lark and will talk in con#temp#tu#ous ton#n of the shark but when the tide rises and shark#h are a#round his voice has a tim#id and trem#u#lous sound that s dif#fer#ent from what i used to say when i was a child sa#id the gryph#on well i nev#er heard it be#fore sa#id the mock tur#tle but it sound#o un#com#mon non#sense alice sa#id noth#ing she had sat down with her face in her hands won#der#ing if an#y#thing would

mock tur#tle per#sist#r how could he turn them out with his nose you know it s the first po#si#tion in danc#ing alice sa#id but was dread#ful#ly puzzled by the whole thing and long#n to change the sub#ject go on with the next verse the gryph#on re#peat#ed impatiently it be#gin#e i passed by his gar#den alice did not dare to dis#o#bey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice i passed by his gar#den and marked with one eye how the owl and the pan#ther were sharing a pie lat#er ed#it#i con#tin#ued as fol#low#o the pan#ther took pie crust and gra#vy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all fin#ished the owl as a boon was kind#ly per#mit#m to pock#et the spoon while the pan#ther re#ceived knife and fork with a growl and con#clud#ed the ban#quet what i#s the use of rep#i all that stuff the mock tur#tle in#ter#rupt#t if you don t ex#plain it as you go on it s by far the most con#fus#ing thing i ev#er heard yes i think you d bet#ter leave off sa#id the gryph#on and alice was on#ly too glad to do so shall we try an#oth#er fig#ure of the lob#ster qua#drille the gryph#on went on or would you like the mock

beau ootiful soo oop soo oop of the e e eve#ning beau#ti#ful beaut#e ful soup cho#rus a#gain cried the gryph#on and the mock tur#tle had just be#gun to re#peat it when a cry of the tri#al s be#gin#ning was heard in the dis#tance come on cried the gryph#on and tak#ing alice by the hand it hur#ried off with#out wait#t for the end of the song what tri#al i#s it alice pant#n as she ran but the gryph#on on#ly answered come on and ran the fast#s while more and more faint#ly came car#ried on the breeze that fol#low#l them the mel#an#chol#y words soo oop of the e e eve#ning beau#ti#ful beau#ti#ful soup chap#ter xi who stole the tart#a the king and queen of hearts were seat#a on their throne when they ar#rived with a great crowd as#sem#bled a#bout them all sort#o of lit#tle bird#i and beast#e as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was stand#ing be#fore them in chain#h with a sol#dier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rab#bit with a trum#pet in one hand and a scroll of parch#ment in the oth#er in the ver#y mid#dle of the court was a ta#ble with a large dish of tart#a up#on it they look#o so good that it made alice quite hun#gry to look at them i wish they d get the tri#al done she thought and hand round the re#fresh#s but there seem#e to be no chance of this so she be#gan look#k at eve#ry#thing a#bout her to pas#s a#way the time alice had nev#er been in a court of jus#tice be#fore but she had read a#bout them in book#o and she was quite pleas#e to find that she knew the name of near#ly eve#ry#thing there that s the judge she sa#id to her#self be#cause of his great wig the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown o#ver the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all com#fort#a#ble and it was cer#tain#ly not be#com#ing and that s the ju#ry box thought alice and those twelve creatures she was o#bliged to say creatures you see be#cause some of them were animals and some were bird#i i sup#pose they are the jurors she sa#id this last word two or three times o#ver to her#self be#ing ra#ther proud of it for she thought and right#ly too that ver#y few lit#tle girl#i of her age knew the mean#ing of it at all how#ev#er ju#ry men would have done just as well the twelve jurors were all writ#ing ver#y bus#i#ly on slat#a what are they do#ing alice whispered to the gryph#on they can t have an#y#thing to put down yet be#fore the tri#al s be#gun they re put#ting down their names the gryph#on whispered in re#ply for fear they should for#get them be#fore the end of the tri#al stu#pid thing#h alice be#gan in a loud in#dig#nant voice but she stopped hast#i#ly for the white rab#bit cried out si#lence in the court and the king put on his spec#ta#cles and look#o anx#ious#ly round to make out who was talk#k alice could see as well as if she were look#k o#ver their should#u that all the jurors were writ#ing down stu#pid thing#h on their slat#a and she could e#ven make out that one of them didn t know how to spell stu#pid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice mud#dle their slat#a ll be in be#fore the tri#al s o#ver thought alice one of the jurors had a pen#cil that squeak#u this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got be#hind him and ver#y soon found an opportunity of tak#ing it a#way she did it so quick#ly that the poor lit#tle ju#ror it was bill the liz#ard could not make out at all what had be#come of it so af#ter hunt#ing all a#bout for it he was o#bliged to write with one fin#ger for the rest of the day and this was of ver#y lit#tle use as it left no mark on the slate her#ald read the ac#cu#sa#tion sa#id the king on this the white rab#bit blew three blast#l on the trum#pet and then unrolled the parch#ment scroll and read as fol#low#o the queen of hearts she made some tart#a all on a sum#mer day the knave of hearts he stole those tart#a and took them quite a#way con#sid#er your ver#dict the king sa#id to the ju#ry not yet not yet the rab#bit hast#i#ly in#ter#rupt#t there s a great deal to come be#fore that call the first wit#ness sa#id the king and the white rab#bit blew three blast#l on the trum#pet and called out first wit#ness the first wit#ness was the hat#ter he came in with a tea#cup in one hand and a piece of bread and but#ter in the oth#er i beg par#don your maj#es#ty he be#gan for bring#ing these in but i hadn t quite fin#ished my tea when i was sent for you ought to have fin#ished sa#id the king when did you be#gin the hat#ter look#o at the march hare

sa#id to the ju#ry and the ju#ry ea#ger#ly wrote down all three dates on their slat#a and then added them up and re#duced the an#swer to shillings and pence take off your hat the king sa#id to the hat#ter it isn t mine sa#id the hat#ter sto#len the king ex#claim#c turn#ing to the ju#ry who in#stant#ly made a mem#o#ran#dum of the fact i keep them to sell the hat#ter added as an ex#pla#na#tion i

large piece out of his tea#cup in#stead of the bread and but#ter just at this mo#ment alice felt a ver#y cu#ri#ous sen#sa#tion which puzzled her a good deal un#til she made out what it was she was be#gin#ning to grow larg#er a#gain and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on se#cond thought#h she de#cid#ed to re#main where she was as long as there was room for her i wish you wouldn t squeeze so sa#id the dor#mouse who was sit#ting next to her i can hard#ly breathe i can t help it sa#id alice ver#y meek#ly i m grow#ing you ve no right to grow he#re sa#id the

sulk#y#l and crossed o#ver to the oth#er side of the court all this time the queen had nev#er left off star#ing at the hat#ter and just as the dor#mouse crossed the court she sa#id to one of the off#e

the queen nev#er sa#id the queen fu#ri#ous#ly throwing an inkstand at the liz#ard as she spoke the un#for#tu#nate lit#tle bill had left off writ#ing on his slate with one fin#ger as he found it made no mark but he now hast#i#ly be#gan a#gain us#ing the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it last#s then the words don t fit you sa#id the king look#k round the court with a smile there was a dead si#lence it s a pun the king added in an of#fend#f tone and eve#ry#bod#y laugh#u let the ju#ry con#sid#er their ver#dict the king sa#id for a#bout the twen#ti#eth time that day no no sa#id the queen sen#tence first ver#dict af#ter#ward#f stuff and non#sense sa#id alice loud#ly the i#de#a of hav#ing the sen#tence first hold your tongue sa#id the queen turn#ing pur#ple i won t sa#id alice off with her head the queen shout#o at the top of her voice no#bod#y moved who car#r for you sa#id alice she had grown to her full size by this time you re noth#ing but a pack of cards at this the whole pack rose up in#to the a#ir and came fly#ing down up#on her she gave a lit#tle scream half of fright and half of an#ger and tried to beat them off and found her#self ly#ing on the bank with her head in the lap of her sis#ter who was gen#tly brush#s a#way some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees up#on her face wake up alice dear sa#id her sis#ter why what a long sleep you ve had oh i ve had such a cu#ri#ous dream sa#id alice and she told her sis#ter as well as she could re#mem#ber them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been read#ing a#bout and when she had fin#ished her sis#ter kiss#s her and sa#id it was a cu#ri#ous dream dear cer#tain#ly but now run in to your tea it s get#ting late so alice got up and ran off think#ing while she ran as well she might what a won#der#ful dream it had been but her sis#ter sat still just as she left her lean#ing her head on her hand watch#c the set#ting sun and think#ing of lit#tle alice and all her won#der#ful adventures till she too be#gan dream#ing af#ter a fash#ion and this was her dream first she dream#e of lit#tle alice her#self and once a#gain the ti#ny hands were clasp#a up#on her knee and the bright ea#ger eyes were look#k up in#to hers she could hear the ver#y ton#n of her voice and see that queer lit#tle toss of her head to keep back the wan#der#ing hair that would al#ways get in#to her eyes and still as she list#e or seem#e to lis#ten the whole place a#round her be#came a#live the strange creatures of her lit#tle sis#ter s dream the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rab#bit hur#ried by the fright#ened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she could hear the rat#tle of the tea#cup#e as the march hare and his friend#r shared their nev#er end#ing meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her un#for#tu#nate guest#u to ex#e#cu#tion once more the pig ba#by was sneez#ing on the duch#ess s knee while plat#a and dish#s crash#a a#round it once more the shriek of the gryph#on the squeak#e of the liz#ard s slate pen#cil and the chok#ing of the sup#press#p guin#ea pigs filled the a#ir mixed up with the dis#tant sob#o of the mis#er#a#ble mock tur#tle so she sat on with closed eyes and half be#lieved her#self in won#der#land though she knew she had but to o#pen them a#gain and all would change to dull re#al#i#ty the grass would be on#ly rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the wav#ing of the reeds the rat#tling tea#cup#e would change to tin#kling sheep be#l#l and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shep#herd boy and the sneeze of the ba#by the shriek of the gryph#on and all the oth#er queer noises would change she knew to the con#fused clamour of the bus#y farm yard while the low#ing of the cat#tle in the dis#tance would take the place of the mock tur#tle s heav#y sob#o last#ly she pic#tured to her#self how this same lit#tle sis#ter of hers would in the af#ter time be her#self a grown wom#an and how she would keep through all her rip#p year#e the sim#ple and lov#ing heart of her child#hood and how she would gath#er a#bout her oth#er lit#tle chil#dren and make their eyes bright and ea#ger with man#y a strange tale per#haps e#ven with the dream of won#der#land of long a#go and how she would feel with all their sim#ple sor#row#o and find a pleas#ure in all their sim#ple joy#o remembering her own child life and the hap#py sum#mer days
